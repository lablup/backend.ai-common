## 21.09.1 (2021-11-11)

### Fixes

* Upgrade aiohttp from 3.7 to 3.8 series ([#95](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/95))
* Adjust the default Redis connection keepalive options to be calculated similarly to how Redis internally does ([#96](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/96))
* Update `async_timeout` API usage ([#97](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/97))


## 21.09.0 (2021-11-08)

### Features
* Add `KernelPullProgressEvent` to represent incremental progress of image pulling when creating new kernels ([#87](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/87))
* Upgrade to aioredis v2 with a major rewrite of the event bus using Redis streams ([#88](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/88))

### Fixes
* Improve stability of test cases using a single Redis container as fixture (a follow-up to #88) ([#91](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/91))
* Prevent "set size changed" error while iterating over event handlers, which may happen on startup on managers ([#92](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/92))
* Explicitly shutdown the thread pool executor used for etcd API invocation ([#94](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/94))

## 21.09.0a2 (2021-09-28)

### Features
* Add support for kubernetes mount types ([eda7a5fa652](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/commit/eda7a5fa652bdfd07f9478cc75a1dc40a5637be7))


## 21.09.0a1 (2021-08-25)

### Features
* Update for the manager scheduler v3 (lablup/backend.ai-manager#415)
  - Fix LogSeverity serialization error for AgentErrorEvent
  - Add new events for the updated manager scheduler ([#76](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/76))
* Implement coalescing of event handler invocation when there are bursts of the same events within a short period of time.
  Also improve stability of event dispatchers by inserting explicit context switches between different events. ([#77](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/77))
* Add the `sd_notify` module to provide detailed status information when run via systemd ([#84](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/84))

### Fixes
* Refine the stability update by recategorizing `KernelCancelledEvent` as a creation event instead of a termination event ([#70](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/70))
* Allow overriding of msgpack wrapper method's keyword argument options. This should have been possible but it was not due to duplicate kwargs errors. ([#79](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/79))
* Update for batch-type session refactor/fix, adding `cancel_tasks()` utility function and refactoring the utils module ([#80](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/80))
* Remove the discouraged `loop` argument from the `AsyncFileWriter` constructor ([#81](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-common/issues/81))
