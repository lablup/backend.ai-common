Revamped the plugin API and subsystem.
- All plugins now must subclass the `common.plugin.AbstractPlugin` interface.
- It is highly recommended to subclass the `common.plugin.BasePluginContext` for specific plugin groups, as it now provides automatic etcd configuration update propagation to individual plugins and the lifecycle management.
- Hook plugins now have explicit and clear semantics for event callbacks such as acceptance via ALL_COMPLETED/FIRST_COMPLETED requirements and one-way notifications, via `HookPluginContext`.
